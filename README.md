### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luka.

I'm a physics student with a strong passion for Machine Learning. I am fluent in Python, and have experience with NumPy and PyTorch(PyTorch Lightning) libraries. I can write well organised reports using LaTex. I'm very proud of my contribution to the instrument recognition machine learning project 'lightning-instrument-recognition', which was developed for the 'Lumen Data Science 2023' competition.
